# RUSLE-Based Soil Erosion Estimation Using Google Earth Engine

This repository contains a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script for estimating annual soil loss using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The model integrates precipitation, soil characteristics, terrain features, vegetation cover, and land use practices. The script also computes class-wise area distribution and sub-basin-wise statistics. This specific implementation is applied to the **Umran basin of Meghalaya**, but you can modify the Area of Interest (AOI) to suit your own study region.

## üìå Model Equation

The core equation used is the **RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation)**:

```
A = R √ó K √ó LS √ó C √ó P
```

Where:

* **A** = Estimated annual soil loss (tonnes per hectare per year)
* **R** = Rainfall erosivity factor
* **K** = Soil erodibility factor
* **LS** = Topographic factor (slope length and steepness)
* **C** = Cover management factor
* **P** = Support practice factor

## üåç Study Area

The area of interest (AOI) in this project is the **Umran basin of Meghalaya**, defined using HydroSHEDS Level 12 basin boundaries. You can change the `mainID` to extract different major river basins or upload your own shapefile or geometry.

```javascript
var dataset = ee.FeatureCollection("WWF/HydroSHEDS/v1/Basins/hybas_12")
var mainID = 4120031730 // Example basin ID (replace for your own AOI)
var aoi = table;
```

## üìà R Factor: Rainfall Erosivity

Derived using CHIRPS precipitation data:

```
R = 0.363 √ó P + 79
```

Where `P` is the total annual precipitation.

```javascript
var current = CHIRPS.filterDate(date1, date2).select('precipitation').sum().clip(aoi);
var R = ee.Image(current.multiply(0.363).add(79)).rename('R');
```

## üß™ K Factor: Soil Erodibility

Based on soil raster classification and a lookup formula for K values:

```
K = f(soil_code) using conditionals based on soil raster codes
```

```javascript
var K = soil.expression("(b('soil') > 11) ? 0.0053 : ... : 0").rename('K');
```

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è LS Factor: Slope Length and Steepness

The LS factor is calculated as:

```
LS = (0.76 + 0.53 √ó S + 0.076 √ó S¬≤) √ó ‚àö(L / 22.13)
```

Where:

* `S` = slope in percentage
* `L` = slope length (fixed as 500 m in this case)

```javascript
var slope = ee.Terrain.slope(elevation).clip(aoi).divide(180).multiply(Math.PI).tan().multiply(100);
var LS4 = Math.sqrt(500/100);
var LS = ((slope.multiply(0.53)).add(slope.pow(2).multiply(0.076)).add(0.76)).multiply(LS4).rename("LS");
```

## üåø C Factor: Vegetative Cover

Based on NDVI (from Sentinel-2):

```
C = exp[-2 √ó NDVI / (1 - NDVI)]
```

C values are normalized between 0 and 1.

```javascript
var image_ndvi = s2.normalizedDifference(['B8','B4']).rename("NDVI");
var C1 = image_ndvi.multiply(-2);
var C = (C1.divide(ee.Image(1).subtract(image_ndvi))).exp().normalize().rename('C');
```

## üöú P Factor: Land Use Management

P is assigned based on LULC class and slope as per FAO recommendations:

```
P = f(LULC, slope) using nested conditionals
```

```javascript
var P = lulc_slope.expression("(b('lulc') < 11) ? 0.8 : ... : 1").rename('P');
```

## üßº Soil Loss Computation

Once all factors are derived, final soil loss is computed as:

```
A = R √ó K √ó LS √ó C √ó P
```

```javascript
var soil_loss = ee.Image(R.multiply(K).multiply(LS).multiply(C).multiply(P)).rename("Soil Loss")
```

## üìä Output

* **Soil Loss Map** with visual classification
* **Pie chart** for erosion class distribution
* **Tabular export** (CSV) of sub-basin wise mean soil loss and area statistics
* **Map Legend Panel** for UI visualization

---

## üìÑ Export

Results can be exported to Google Drive as CSV files using `Export.table.toDrive` for class-wise and sub-basin-wise summaries.

---

## üßê Notes

* All calculations are scale-dependent; use appropriate spatial resolution (\~500 m).
* Modify parameters (e.g., slope length, alpha-beta for NDVI-to-C conversion) to match regional characteristics.
